## Description

MeteoLibre Model is an open-source project dedicated to creating accessible and accurate weather forecasting models. Initially focused on France, the project aims to provide short-term weather predictions using data from weather and radar stations.

## Introduction

The MeteoLibre Model project is driven by the idea of democratizing weather forecasting. By leveraging open data sources and modern machine learning techniques, we aim to develop models that are both accurate and accessible to researchers, developers, and weather enthusiasts. Our primary goal is to forecast weather conditions in France using only weather and radar station inputs, offering a transparent and customizable alternative to proprietary weather services.

## Model Architecture

The project explores various model architectures to achieve optimal forecasting performance:

*   **UNET:** Used in early experiments, providing a baseline for image-based weather prediction.
*   **DiT (Diffusion Transformer):** A diffusion-based model that has shown promising results in generating high-quality weather forecasts.
*   **2D and 3D Transformers:** Explored for capturing spatial and temporal dependencies in weather data.

The architecture focuses on forecasting the evolution of radar images and incorporating ground station data to enrich the feature space.

## Data Sources

The model utilizes data from multiple sources:

*   **Weather Stations:** Provide ground-level weather measurements such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure.
*   **Radar Stations:** Offer real-time radar imagery, capturing precipitation patterns and intensity.
*   **Other Data Sources:** Includes topology data and ground type information from sources like IGN (Institut GÃ©ographique National).

These diverse data sources are crucial for creating a comprehensive and accurate weather model.

## Dataset and Preprocessing

The project has experimented with different datasets:

*   **Meteo France Radar Data:** Initial tests were conducted using radar data from Meteo France.
*   **UK Dataset:** A more structured dataset that has shown better learning results, particularly with the DiT architecture.

Preprocessing steps involve cleaning, normalizing, and transforming the data into suitable formats for model training.

## Training and Evaluation

The models are trained using scripts located in the `scripts/` directory. Key training scripts include:

*   `training_grid.py`: Initial training script for Meteo France radar data.
*   `training_grid_uk.py`: Training script for the UK dataset using UNET.
*   `training_grid_uk_dit.py`: Training script for the UK dataset using the DiT architecture.
*   `training_grid_uk_dit_local.py`: Training script for the UK dataset using the DiT architecture with local modifications.

Evaluation metrics include visual inspection of forecast accuracy and quantitative measures of image similarity.

## Current Status
